<h1>Digit Recognition Classification model</h1>
<ul>Steps to create classification model
  <li>Load the Dataset</li>
  <li>Perform image preprocessing</li>
  <li> Create A CNN model</li>
  <li>test the model</li>
  <li>Evoluate the model</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Load the Dataset</h2>
<p>first step is load the dataset with the help of pandas library, <b>read_csv</b> is used to import csv, excel and more format dataset, in this model creation we have used <b>mnist </b> dataset  have used which have 50k training and 10k have testing data of digit from 0-9.</p>
<br>
<h2>Image Preprocesing
</h2>
<p> Before giving image as input, we have to preprocess it.</p>
